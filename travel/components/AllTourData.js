The second highest peak of Kashmir, Gangbal is one of the most popular places to hike. The trail starts from Naranaag, a 45 kms drive from Srinagar. Naranaag features the ruins of ancient Shiva temple, surrounded by breath-taking peaks. Once we start hiking from Naranaag, all the way via the forest block to reach the lush green TrundKul valley, we get to see the first glimpse of previously obscured Harmukh Peak. The trail all the way is a heaven walk, at the end of which we find the pristine twin alpine lakes that is NundKul and Gangbal lakes. The two sister Lakes present a life time experience with the vibrant colours that contract the everlasting snows of the Harmukh peak in the backdrop. One of the best camping destinations in Kashmir, Gangbal lake trek is not only common for its beauty but also has the spiritual importance in Kashmir.

We at MULTI DESTINATIONS would follow the traditional route unless on a special request. The Tarsar Marsar Lakes are among the beautiful alpine lakes of Kashmir that would present an amazing hiking experience and are accessible only in summer time.
