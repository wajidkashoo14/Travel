And never for two days together is this glorious panorama exactly the same. One day, Patnitop is filled with a sea of rolling clouds through which gleams of sunshine light up the brilliant green of the meadows below. On another day there is no cloud in the sky and the whole scene will be bathed in a blue haze.

    Discover your own trekking or walking trails in and around Patnitop or go for a lovely drive around the scenic, curving mountain roads, which go through Deodar forests and across streams. Enjoy a meal or a drink on our beautiful terrace with a bonfire and gaze at the unobstructed views that extend as far as the town of Kud or the Natha Top Hills.
    
    Hotel Samson extends over 2 acres and is dotted with apple trees, weeping willows, pine cedars and a variety of seasonal flowers and shrubs. With extensive lawns, mounds and park benches, guests can unwind and just lie down and read a book or absorb the scenic views around the hotel and come closest to nature.
    
    The hotel consists of three categories of rooms, namely Deluxe, Superior and Executive. All the rooms are equipped with modern amenities and offer a sublime and panoramic view of pristine surroundings, lush landscapes and snow-capped mountains which will leave you spellbound.
    
    The hotel also has a terrace bonfire to enjoy the evenings watching the scenic beauty around the property.`,

    Built from locally quarried granite, native cedarwood, and traditional Kashmiri brickwork, the resort is exquisite in its contradictions – modern yet traditional, simple yet intricate. It has a distinctive character with its chalet-style units with Alpine influences, set over 3 acres, within an apple orchard, framed by towering poplars. It pays homage to the Mughal gardens and historical buildings of the area, and the Kashmiri detailing is inescapable.
    An open-air swimming pool with a hot tub; restaurants with ample outdoor seating and incredible views serve delightful meals: a gym and a snooker room. Added to this are sprawling gardens, picturesque views of the Dal and Nageen lakes, and the Zabarwan Mountains as the backdrop, make this resort an ideal getaway and a place that you might never want to leave. We will make you fall in love with Srinagar and of course our beloved Kashmir!`,

    address: "Betaab Valley Road, Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir",
    description: `Since Pahalgam is nearly 90 kilometers away from the flurry of activity that defines Srinagar, it is the ideal destination to put your feet up, snuggle into a comfy couch, and sip cup after cup of Kehwa. While you are at it, watch the snow sketch a pattern on your window. Pahalgam is also a trekker’s delight, serving as a base for several treks that cut through the mountains and scamper alongside the river. For adrenaline junkies, river rafting is a viable option. For those looking to relax, golf at the Pahalgam Golf Course and fishing at the river will clinch the deal. Whatever your reason for visiting Pahalgam is, a stay at Pahalgam Pines will make sure you take back home memories to last a lifetime.`,
